## Abstract


This thesis examines how the legalization of same-sex marriage affected wages among same-sex cohabiting adults in the United States. Using American Community Survey (ACS) microdata from 2000–2019 and exploiting the staggered legalization across the U.S. states, I implement a difference-in-differences design that contrasts same-sex with different-sex cohabiting couples before and after state legalization. I found no meaningful participation response on the extensive margin for both men and women. However, the intensive margin shows small but precise, opposite-signed treatment effects on wage: roughly +3% for men and -2.3% for women. As a result, the pre-existing gay ”wage penalty” and lesbian ”wage premium” both shrank after legalization, but did not reverse. Heterogeneity by earner role is consistent with a household specialization mechanism.
